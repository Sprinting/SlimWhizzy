# SlimWhizzy
SlimWhizzy is a learning excercise turned proof of concept based on creating a very slim WYSWIYG editor with only pure JavaScript and HTML5 ContentEditable. It is not intended to be used as a framework or library but rather a starting point for building a customized editor for your website or application. It can be completely skinned as desired, the only requirements (without modifying the *SlimWhizzy.js* file) is that the buttons have the data-command attribute matching the appropriate syntax outlined in demo.
